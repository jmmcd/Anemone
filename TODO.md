# TODO


* Replace our EC with Program Trace Optimisation (simple version) or PODI

* Provide GE as a built-in 

* Allow user to paste in a grammar using standard drawing commands

* Hotkeys

* Remove the test MIDI note that plays at startup and refactor the MIDI

* Individual can state its preference for (width, height) in the grid

* Pre-made visualisers for text, bitstrings, etc

* Visualiser can be from genome, phenotype, or both, it's up to the individual

* getPhenotype() should cache it

* Just a hook to say which individual is active?

* Controls for popsize, mutation rate..?

* Another type of individual, GL shaders https://tympanus.net/codrops/2025/06/23/modeling-the-world-in-280-characters/

* Another type of individual, brain-computer interface music-mapping

* In the pattern individual, theta tends to be bad, so better would be sin theta and cos theta? With factor of 2 pi.
